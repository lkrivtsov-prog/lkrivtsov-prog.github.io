(text-style:"mark","underline")[=
The day of a monk in a Tudor monastery typically began with the ringing of bells at dawn, signaling the monks to rise from their simple sleeping quarters, which were often small, austere cells furnished with a bad, desk, and a few personal possessions. The monks would then gather in the monastery's chapel of church for the first of several daily services. After morning prayers, the monks would proceed to the refectory for breakfast, which consisted of a simple meal. Meals were typically taken in silence, with the monks listening to a reading from the Bible or a religious text as they ate.  Following breakfast, the monks would engage in manual labor, a vital part of monastic life. The type of work varied depending on the monastery's buildings and gardens. In the afternoon, the monks would gather once again for the midday prayers followed by lunch, which was another frugal meal. Afterward, they would return to their assigned tasks until the evening.  They have more prayers during the day and the nighttime prayers before retiring to their cells for rest [[Roles]]

The Dominicans, known as the Order of Preachers, are a prominent religious order within the Catholic Church founded by Saint Dominic de Guzman in the early 13 century. They are also known as the Black Friars due to their black robes. One notable Dominican figure during the Tudor period was John Fisher. He was made a cardinal by Pope Paul III in 1535. However, Fisher's loyalty to the Catholic Church led to his eventual execution by King Henry VIII.  ]    [[Food]]

As a result of the Reformation, monasteries were dissolved and were subjected to a series of suppressions between 1536 and 1540.  Monastic lands and assets were confiscated by the crown, and many monks were either pensioned off or forced to abandon their religious life. The dissolution of the monasteries had a profound impact on the lives of the monks. It brought an abrupt end to centuries of monastic tradition, leaving many monks displaced and communities disbanded. The loss of their spiritual homes and the disruption of their way of life must have been a deeply traumatic experience for these individuals who had devoted themselves to their faith.  Other Tudor monarchs, like Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I, had different religious policies. In the end, Elizabeth I made a rule in 1559 that said England's church was Protestant but allowed some religious freedom. ]

Food in the Tudor monastery was simple. Bred was a dietary staple and the main source of sustenance. Monasteries typically baked their own bread and it was consumed daily, both as a basic food and for the Eucharist. Ale was the primary beverage in monastic life, as it was believed to be safer to drink than water due to potential contamination. Monasteries often had their own breweries, and ale was brewed regularly.  Monastic gardens provided vegetables such as cabbage, leeks, onions, peas, beans, and turnips which were used to make soups and stews.  They also ate fish, milk, butter, cheese, eggs, herbs and spices, and pottage. On special occasions or feast days, monks enjoyed roast meats and desserts.]    [[Vow of obedience to the abbot]]

(text-colour:white)+(bg:navy)(enchant:?passage,(text-colour:white)+(bg:blue))During the Tudor period in England, which lasted from the late 15th century to the early 17th century, monastic life had significant changes and challenges, ultimately leading to its dissolution under King Henry VIII. Tudor monasteries were vibrant centers of religious life, serving as both spiritual sanctuaries and hubs of community support. The life of a monk in a Tudor monastery was a deeply structured and devout existence, characterized by rigorous religious devotion, asceticism, and a commitment to a life of prayer and service to God. Monks were part of various religious orders, such as Benedictines, Franciscans, and Dominicans, each with its own unique traditions and rules.

The Reformation in Tudor times was a big change in England during the 16th century.
